          <p class="subtext">Interactive Power BI Dashboard that analyzes movie and studio performances</p>
          <p class="subtext2"></b>Description:</p>
          <p class="subtext2">I love movies and I always look up movie revenues for films I enjoyed watching (I guess as way to validate if others enjoyed it as much as I did!) so I thought this was the perfect project to work on.
          I used Python to call a public API and saved the data to a JSONL file.  After I analyzed the data and determined the data model and tables I needed, 
          I processed and cleaned the data into csv files I used for Power BI.  Then I researched and determined metrics and KPIs to build using DAX and came up with a layout that would give insight to movie revenues.
            </p>
